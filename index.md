## About {#about}

I am an aspiring researcher and educator specializing in CSE, with keen interests in **Vision Language Models**, **Robotics**, **NLP**, **LLM**, **Security of LLM** and **Healthcare AI**. My academic journey began at **Khulna University of Engineering & Technology(KUET)**, **Bangladesh** and I currently serve as a **Lecturer** in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at **Southeast University**, **Bangladesh**. In this role, I am actively involved in teaching, research, and mentorship. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated resilience, embraced collaborative efforts, and remain committed to contributing high quality scholarly work that advances the field. I am currently pursuing opportunities to undertake a **PhD** to further deepen my research expertise.
